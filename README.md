Simple SDS
==========

Simple SDS is a set of Fortran 90 modules that wrap NetCDF (and
eventually, HDF) routines to add better error reporting and
automatically stop the program on error.  Behavior that we find useful
in our programs but may not be appropriate for every NetCDF
application.  In addition, some convenience routines will be provided
for common high-level operations such as reading in exactly one
variable from a file.
